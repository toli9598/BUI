This is a short examample implementation of the bazel build management. The application prints a welcoming message alongside a time and date.

To build the application, use `bazel build main:hello_world`. The result can be found in BUI/bazel-bin/main.

To build and run the application, use `bazel run main:hello_world`.

To run a complete clean, use `bazel clean --expunge`.
